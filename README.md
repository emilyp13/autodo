###My breakable toy is a productivity management app, similar to Trello, using React and Rails.

##Features

* React Drag and Drop Component
>To drag cards across lists, I used the React DnD component. [Component Found Here](https://github.com/gaearon/react-dnd).

* Filter Cards by Tags
>I used react to dynamically filter cards by tags.

* Daily Task Emails
>To receive a daily email, I used ActionMailer and Heroku Schedulizer.
